# Scooter_Detector

## 🌻Description
This project aims to create AI models using YOLOv5. The models detect whether a driver is wearing a helmet, detect multiple passengers, and detect scooters for potential CCTV applications. The dataset is not included in the code.

- Detecting if the driver is wearing a helmet(Helmet_best.pt)
- Detecting two or more drivers(Multi_passenger3.pt)
- Detecting scooters (Scooter_best.pt)

## 🌻Getting Started
- Python Version : Python 10
- Development IDE : PyCharm 2023 Community Edition
- Frameworks and Tools :
  - YOLOv5 : Utilized for object detection, acquired from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).
  - LabelImg : Used for image annotation, downloaded from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg).
- Operating System :
  - Initial development on Windows.
  - Subsequent development and testing on Kali Linux.
