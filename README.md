# Scooter_Detecter
###### This project is still in progress. I wanted to create an AI model that detects scooters within cctv, but the YOLOv5 I used was not enough to detect small objects within CCTV. So I first created an AI model that detects large objects. I'm going to re-project using Faster R-CNN with higher accuracy.
##### This project is a project to create AI models using YOLOv5. I made AI that detects whether a driver is wearing a helmet or not, and detects if there are more than one driver. I also created an AI model that detects scooters because I aimed to detect them within CCTV. The data set is not included in the code.

## üåªFeatures
- Detecting if the driver is wearing a helmet(Helmet_best.pt)
- Detecting two or more drivers(Multi_passenger3.pt)
- Detecting scooters (Scooter_best.pt)

## üåªProject Environment
- Python Version : Python 10
- Development IDE : PyCharm 2023 Community Edition
- Frameworks and Tools :
  - YOLOv5 : Utilized for object detection, acquired from its GitHub repository.
  - LabelImg : Used for image annotation, downloaded from its GitHub repository.
- Operating System :
  - Initial development on Windows.
  - Subsequent development and testing on Kali Linux.
